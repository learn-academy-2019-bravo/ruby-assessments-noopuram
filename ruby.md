Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
Its same as JS functions like a block of code with a name and it returns or executes when it calls

#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer] A lower class can access the features of its upperclass


[Googled Answer] Inheritance is a relation between two classes. In Ruby, a class can only inherit from a single other class.


#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer With RSpec we can test our code with possible outcomes.

//Googled Answer RSpec is an automated testing framework for Ruby. Testing frameworks are used by a developers to create tests for actions, functions, or methods in their program ensuring that the code runs properly.


#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

//Your Answer i cant find any from google

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

<!-- ```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}" -->
Display the value stored in variable x so the out put should be "I am printing a random number 1022"
```

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
testing became more easy
//Googled Answer
BDD – Behavior-Driven Development – is perhaps the biggest source of confusion. When applied to automated testing, BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests. BDD can, and should be, used together with TDD and unit testing methods.

One of the key things BDD addresses is implementation detail in unit tests. A common problem with poor unit tests is they rely too much on how the tested function is implemented. This means if you update the function, even without changing the inputs and outputs, you must also update the test. This is a problem because it makes doing changes tedious.

Behavior-Driven Development addresses this problem by showing you how to test. You should not test implementation, but instead behavior.

#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?

//Your Answer
instance variable is used to store values of an instance of objects

//Googled Answer
An instance variable is local to a specific instance of an object. If one object changes the value of the instance variable, the change only occurs for that object. A local variable can be used only within the method in which it is defined (or, when the variable is defined at the top level, only outside of any method)
#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
Ruby in 20 min is something great to reed its telling about built in modules and methods.

Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.
